Nicholas Ezzell is a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow at the University of Southern California pursuing his PhD in physics. He holds a Bachelor's of Science in both Physics and Mathematics from Mississippi State University where he was a Presidential and Goldwater Scholar.  Broadly, his research focuses on the study of quantum systems by both classical algorithms and near-term quantum algorithms. At USC, he works with Daniel Lidar and Itay Hen on methods to identify quantum phase transitions with quantum Monte Carlo and/or machine learning via fidelity susceptibility. Prior, he spent time developing variational quantum algorithms to learn mixed states and unitaries at Los Alamos National Laboratory hosted by Andrew Sornborger, Zo&euml; Holmes, and Patrick Coles.
