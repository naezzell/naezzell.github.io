Welcome to my website.

Here, you will find a mixture of
- strict professional information (e.g., [[publications](/publications)] and [[my cv](/cv)])
- a [[blog](/blog)]  where I share pedagogic tutorials in math relevant to quantum theory and general thoughts on my research journey
- and thoughts on my ongoing journey to perfect my coffee and matcha recipes.
