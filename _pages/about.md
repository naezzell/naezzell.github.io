Hi. Welcome to my web site.

I am a physics PhD student at the University of Southern California jointly advised by Daniel Lidar and Itay Hen. At the same time, I've spent a lot of my PhD working with Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the benefits of being a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF). My research falls into the worlds of quantum computation, quantum information, and classical simulations of quantum systems.

I created a web site because I enjoy scientific communication and wanted to start a blog. My target audience are those students trying to learn a new concept for the first time but getting stumped by the conventional explanations. I enjoy breaking things down from a "simple as possible" perspective and demystifying historical jargon. Upon going to the trouble, I realized I might as well use it as an "interactive CV" and a scratch space for my food and drink explorations.
