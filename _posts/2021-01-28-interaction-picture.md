Suppose you split a Hamiltonian into two parts,

$$
H = H_S + H_{SB},
$$

where $H_S$ acts on the system of interest and $H_{SB}$ characterizes the interaction between the system and the bath.

The total system–bath density matrix satisfies the Liouville–von Neumann equation

$$
\dot{\rho}(t) = -i [H, \rho(t)].
$$

But suppose we are only interested in the dynamics induced from $H_{SB}$ specifically.  It turns out we can effectively remove the $H_S$ contribution by entering the aptly named **interaction picture**, which is a special choice of a [[rotating frame](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/222104/what-is-the-interaction-picture-or-rotating-frame-in-quantum-mechanics)].

## Interaction picture state

Instead of studying $\rho(t)$, we define the interaction-picture state

$$
\tilde{\rho}(t) = U_S^\dagger(t)\,\rho(t)\,U_S(t),
$$

where

$$
U_S(t) = e^{-i H_S t},
$$

assuming $\dot{H}_S = 0$.

This transformation rotates the density matrix into a time-dependent basis. Intuitively, we are *unrotating* the bare $H_S$ dynamics so that only the effect of $H_{SB}$ remains.

## Interaction picture evolution

The transformed state satisfies

$$
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t) = -i [\tilde{H}(t), \tilde{\rho}(t)],
$$

where the interaction-picture Hamiltonian is

$$
\tilde{H}(t) = U_S^\dagger(t)\, H_{SB}\, U_S(t).
$$

So the dynamics are generated solely by the interaction Hamiltonian expressed in the rotating frame.

## Proof

We differentiate

$$
\tilde{\rho}(t) = U_S^\dagger(t)\,\rho(t)\,U_S(t)
$$

using the product rule

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
&=
\dot{U}_S^\dagger(t)\,\rho(t)\,U_S(t)
+
U_S^\dagger(t)\,\dot{\rho}(t)\,U_S(t)
+
U_S^\dagger(t)\,\rho(t)\,\dot{U}_S(t).
\end{aligned}
$$

Using

$$
\dot{U}_S(t) = -i H_S U_S(t),
\qquad
\dot{U}_S^\dagger(t) = i H_S U_S^\dagger(t),
$$

and substituting the Liouville equation $\dot{\rho}(t) = -i[H,\rho(t)]$, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
&=
(i H_S U_S^\dagger)\rho U_S
+
U_S^\dagger (-i[H,\rho]) U_S
+
U_S^\dagger \rho (-i U_S H_S).
\end{aligned}
$$

Factor out $U_S^\dagger$ and $U_S$

$$
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
=
U_S^\dagger
\left(
i H_S \rho
- i[H,\rho]
- i \rho H_S
\right)
U_S.
$$

Since $H = H_S + H_{SB}$, expand the commutator

$$
[H,\rho] = [H_S,\rho] + [H_{SB},\rho].
$$

The $H_S$ terms cancel, leaving

$$
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
=
U_S^\dagger
\left(
-i H_{SB}\rho + i \rho H_{SB}
\right)
U_S.
$$

Now insert the identity $I = U_S U_S^\dagger$ conveniently

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
&=
-i U_S^\dagger H_{SB} (U_S U_S^\dagger) \rho U_S
+
i U_S^\dagger \rho (U_S U_S^\dagger) H_{SB} U_S.
\end{aligned}
$$

Recognizing

$$
\tilde{\rho} = U_S^\dagger \rho U_S,
\qquad
\tilde{H} = U_S^\dagger H_{SB} U_S,
$$

we obtain

$$
\dot{\tilde{\rho}}(t)
=
-i \tilde{H} \tilde{\rho}
+
i \tilde{\rho} \tilde{H}
=
-i[\tilde{H}, \tilde{\rho}(t)].
$$

## Interpretation

The interaction picture cleanly separates

- The **free evolution** generated by $H_S$
- The **interaction dynamics** generated by $H_{SB}$

By moving to the rotating frame defined by $H_S$, we isolate the physical effect of the system–bath coupling.

## Use of interaction picture to analyze dynamical decoupling

The interaction picture is routinely used in the quantum computation literature, but the area I am the most familiar with is is in dynamical decoupling (DD). In this case, we usually enter the interaction picture induced by the control Hamiltonian, $H_c(t)$, that is thus often called the **toggling frame.** A list of historical references for its use in NMR and early DD papers can be found in
-  Appendix D of [[arXiv:2207.03670](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03670)]

and a thorough description of its use in the "standard analysis pipeline of DD" can be found in

- Section III of [[arXiv:0911.3202](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3202)].

A very intereting interaction picture (but specifically *not* just the toggling frame) analysis of DD for superconducting qubits is carried out in

- Appendix G and H of [[arXiv:2108.04530](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04530)].
